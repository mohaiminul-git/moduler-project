# 📦 Moduler Project – Delivery Time Prediction App

This project is a **modular machine learning pipeline** designed to predict delivery times based on historical data. It follows a clean, production-ready architecture with custom modules for each pipeline step and is wrapped in an interactive **Streamlit app** for ease of use.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 **Modular architecture** for scalability and reusability
- 📥 **Data ingestion** from raw sources
- 🧹 **Data transformation** with preprocessing and cleaning
- 🎯 **Model training** with customizable pipelines
- 📈 **Batch prediction** using saved models
- 🌐 **Streamlit app** for real-time delivery time prediction
- 📦 Ready for deployment with `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`
